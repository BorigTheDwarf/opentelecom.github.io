      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><strong>open-source</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; software denotes software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be freely distributed and modified as defined in section 1.02 &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo;. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="open-source-access"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.02 Open Source Access &amp; Distribution</span></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open source is fundamental to the purpose of the Corporation. Open source does not simply imply free access to the source code. If order to be recognised as open-source, in the context of the Corporation and its activities, the distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Free Redistribution:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Source Code: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Derived Works:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Integrity of The Author's Source Code: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons. </span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Distribution of License:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>License Must Not Restrict Other Software:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>License Must Be Technology-Neutral:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="interpretation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.03 Interpretation</span></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interpretation of this by-law, words in the singular include the plural and vice-versa, words in one gender include all genders, and "person" includes an individual, body corporate, partnership, trust and unincorporated organization.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than as specified in 1.01 above, words and expressions defined in the Act have the same meanings when used in these by-laws.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 id="execution-docs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.05 Execution of Documents</span></h2>

The banking business or any part of it shall be transacted by an officer or officers of the Corporation and/or other persons as the board of directors may by resolution from time to time designate, direct or authorize.</span></p>
    <h2 id="annual-financial"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.08 Annual Financial Statements</span></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corporation may, instead of sending copies of the annual financial statements and other documents referred to in subsection 172(1) (Annual Financial Statements) of the Act to the members, publish a notice to its members stating that the annual financial statements and documents provided in subsection 172(1) are available at the registered office of the Corporation and any member may, on request, obtain a copy free of charge at the registered office or by prepaid mail.</span></p>
