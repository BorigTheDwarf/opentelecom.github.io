# Mission

The Open Telecom Foundation.s (OTF) mission is:
* To advance the adoption of open source telecommunications technologies based on open standards and open protocols
* To promote the design and development of reliable and resilient telecommunications platforms using open source and open standards components

We do this by:
* educating telecommunications service providers in best practices of building and deploying carrier-grade telecommunications services
* by providing technology researchers and software programmers with the development and collaboration tools and resources necessary to contribute to the development, documentation and support of open source and open standards telecommunications projects and initiatives

We do this for:
* the public benefit of telecommunications services subscribers, who receive higher-quality, more reliable, greater interoperability and lower cost services when using open source telecommunications technologies based open standards and protocols.
