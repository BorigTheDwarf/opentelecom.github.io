In our last meeting, our founding group of members established core areas of focus and collaboration. Chief among our shared concerns was coordinating the continued open source development of the Kazoo open source project and particularly the Kazoo ACDc module. 

Our shared view is that without a community of developers making consistent useful contributions, the future of the Kazoo open source project was grim. We each provided a list of possible foundation names to rally around. After much discussion and 2 rounds of voting, we decided that *Open Telecom Foundation* was the best name to convey our purpose and our goals. 

Some have asked, if your focus started primarily with the Kazoo project, why is Kazoo not in your name? Why aren't you called the "Open Kazoo Foundation"? This is a great question. Although the health of Kazoo project is a fundamental concern for our group, it doesn't convey the scope of our interests. We are a group of independent internet telephony service providers (ITSPs) all working together using a collection of open source telecommunications projects. 

In conjunction with the core Kazoo project, we also use Kamailio, FreeSWITCH, HAProxy, CouchDB, and RabbitMQ as connected components, yet independent open source projects. Additionally, there are other open source projects (Linux, KVM/Qemu, Docker, Apache, Homer, VoIPmonitor, CGrates, etc.) that our members use that do not connect to, nor are inter-dependant with the Kazoo open source project. Given this larger scope of work and of interest, and our concerns for open source projects and open protocols, we feel that Open Telecom Foundation correctly conveys our purpose.
