Now that the Open Telecom Foundation is now a legal entity, our members can offiatially [join as members](/new_member_join.html) after first reading and agreeing to our foundation [By-Laws](/bylaws.html).

Today, **Xentric**, from Uruguay, has joined as a _Silver Member_ and is represented by volunteer _Silver Director_ Alvaro Vargas on the founding OTF Board. 

As a _Silver Member_, Xentric is happy to contribute its annual OTF membership fee, paid in monthly instalments.
