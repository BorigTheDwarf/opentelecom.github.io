After our original ad-hoc meeting in San Francisco, our members started to discuss what kind of organazation we should create. We began collecting the various questions and ideas that were discussed in person and began to refine our ideas on how best to work together. 

* How should we meet?
* What is our group vision?
* What name should we use?
* What type of structure would be best for our work?
* What should our initial scope of work be?
* Do we need staff?
* How will we operate?
