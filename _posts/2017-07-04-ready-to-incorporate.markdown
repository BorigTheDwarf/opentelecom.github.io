After months of discussions formulating our By-Laws, we have collected all of the required signatures from our 7 founding volunteer Directors:

* Alvaro Vargas

* Graham Nelson-Zutter
* Jose Paz

With the content of our founding Board of Directors, the Open Telecom Foundation is ready to file incorporation documents as a federal non-for-profit in Canada.
