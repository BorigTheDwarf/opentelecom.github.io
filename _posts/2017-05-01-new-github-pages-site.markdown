Following our open source objectives, we have selected GitHub Pages as our website host. Our domain name [http://opentelecom.foundation](http://opentelecom.foundation) now points to our new GitHub repo [https://github.com/OpenTelecom/opentelecom.github.io](https://github.com/OpenTelecom/opentelecom.github.io).

Our goal in using GitHub Pages is that our members are easially able to update content in a transparant and easy way. 

The Jekyll engine and markdown based content make for a great basic site that can support blog entries.
